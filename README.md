# API-Loading
This was made as a coding challenge where I was given a URL and told to replicate an image (replicateThis.PNG) as a website. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
This web page should launch in any web browser. When you launch the page, it shows a dynamic roster of team members. This roster should update with any changes to the API given.
